# odin-dashboard
Here, I designed an education dashboard, where students could see their classes amonst other features and navigate to wherever they wanted to. (The navigation bit doesn't work though, this is purely HTML and CSS with one page only!)

This little project was meant to apply my newly learnt Grid skills. Well, I was given the autonomy of deciding between Grid and Flexbox, so I decided to use each of them for the scenarios where they would work best in.
- Grid works awesomely in creating responsive layout, as shown in the 'Your Classes' section.
- On the other hand, I like to use Flexbox in places like the 'Announcements' or 'People' as it allowed me to easily  space all my items out equally and make the box take up as much space as possible.
